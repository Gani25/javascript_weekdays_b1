    1. WAP to accept 2 numbers from user and check if their last digit is same or not
    n1 = 563, n2 = 16893
    last_digit = 3 -> in both so last digit of 563 and 16893 is same
    
    2. WAP to calculate electricity bill:
    Accept unit consumed:
    a. if unit consumed is less than or equal to 100 -> then charge amount 5/unit
    b. if unit consumed is between 101 to 200 -> then charge amount 8/unit
    c. if unit consumed is more than 200 -> then charge amount 15/unit
    After bill_amount add fixed amount of 150Rs
    Display Final Amount and Unit Consumed
